# NoobDocs
## Overview
A plain simple markdown editor and manager written in Godot very loosely inspired by Google Docs and the need to make a simple but good looking document editor.

## Technical Information:
Uses MarkdownLabel by daenvil to display the markdown on the screen. NoobDocs is using the Compatibility renderer in Godot so it should (hopefully) run on essentially any hardware released in the pass ten years. All save files are stored in JSON so any language can be used to open the files that this program outputs. Every document is stored in this JSON database. Users can manually create backups of this database using a button in the UI.

## Features:
- Creating new documents
- Editing existing documents
- Deleting documents
- Image Support (very finicky/unstable)
