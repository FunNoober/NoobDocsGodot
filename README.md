# NoobsDoc
A plain simple markdown editor and manager written in Godot. Uses MarkdownLabel by daenvil to display the markdown on the screen.

NoobsDoc is using the Compatibility renderer in Godot so it should (hopefully) run on essentially any hardware released in the pass ten years.

## Features:
- Creating new documents
- Editing existing documents
- Deleting documents
- Image Support (very finicky/unstable)
